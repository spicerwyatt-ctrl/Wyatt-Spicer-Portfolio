                  <h3>Lack of Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>
                      The FTC's qualitative study on first-time car buyers revealed widespread confusion, hidden costs, and a lack of transparency in the buying process. Most participants did not realize that add-on products (like warranties or GAP insurance) could be negotiated, and some even believed they had received them for free, only to later find hidden charges in their paperwork.

        <p>
          At the end of the day, the problem is pretty clear. First-time car buyers, especially students, are stepping into a process that feels confusing and intimidating because they do not have the information or confidence they need. GoCapital works to change that by giving them a simple, transparent, and personalized tool that helps them move through each part of buying a car. It helps students compare costs, get ready for conversations at the dealership, and understand what long-term ownership really looks like.
        </p>
        <p>
          By making everything easier to follow, GoCapital turns a stressful experience into something manageable. This solution gives young buyers the practical support they have been asking for: clear information, better preparation, and the ability to make confident, informed decisions.

        <p class="lead">
          MovieHouse is an all-in-one app designed to replace the overwhelming number of disconnected tools used in dine-in movie theaters. Instead of juggling separate systems for scheduling, time punches, radios, training, payroll, theater assignments, guest alerts, and analytics, MovieHouse brings everything into one unified app.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project focuses on real problems you experienced during nearly a decade of restaurant work: redundant apps, constant logins, inefficiency, and poor communication. Through sketches, wireframes, prototypes, and user scenarios, the app centralizes daily tasks for servers and managers, making shifts easier, faster, and less stressful for everyone.
